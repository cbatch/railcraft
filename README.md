## Our Story

For years, my wife and I have been obsessed with those classic rail games—the ones where you’re hunched over drawing on a massive map, trying to craft the perfect route.
          
The only problem? Those maps are huge, and eventually, we actually needed our table back for eating.

Railcraft is designed to capture that same strategy and depth right in our pockets.

This game is dedicated to my favorite opponent (my wife) and to every tabletop strategist who’d rather be building an empire than clearing the table for dinner.
